        <h2>What is in this course?</h2>

        <p>This course is about the basic mathematics that is fundamental and essential component in all streams of
            undergraduate studies in sciences and engineering. The course consists of topics in differential
            calculus,integral calculus, linear algebra and differential equations with applications to various engineering
            problems. This course will cover the following main topics: Mean Value Theorems; Indeterminate
            Forms; Taylor's and Maclaurin's Theorems. Partial Derivatives; Differentiability; Taylor's Expansion of
            Functions of Several Variables. Maxima and Minima. Improper Integrals. Differentiation under Integral Sign
            (Leibnitz rule).Multiple Integrals and their Properties. Applications of Multiple Integrals. System of Linear
            Equations. Vector Spaces; Basis and Dimension of a Vector Space. Rank of a Matrix and its Properties. Linear
            Transformation. Eigenvalues and Eigen vectors. Diagonalization . First Order Differential Equations. Higher
            Order Differential Equations with Constant Coefficients. Cauchy-Euler Equations.

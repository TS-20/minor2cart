        <h2>What is in this course?</h2>
        <p>
            Literature can be described as a body of written work with artistic or intellectual value. In addition to genre, literature can be categorized by narrative technique or writing style. Literature can be fiction or nonfiction; it can also be poetry or prose. Long-form novels, short stories, and dramas are other examples of literary works. And, literature is often contextualized by region or the period in which it was written.
        </p>
        <p>This course is an introduction to a wide range of writings produced in different nations, languages and cultural contexts. While this course cannot claim to cover all literary traditions from all time periods, it does try to introduce the learners to representative texts that are available in English language. The objective of the course is to focus on learning how great writings can intervene and engage with global cultures while remaining rooted and situated in their specific, local contexts. These discussions need to be seen as ‘entry points’ that would enable to learners to explore world literatures.
